#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) This one has just one loop and there is no nested loop so answer is O(n)

b) This one has one for loop O(n) and one nested while loop (doubled each time) O(log(n)) so answer is O(n\*log(n))

c) this is classic recursive operatiob so answer is O(n)

## Exercise II
